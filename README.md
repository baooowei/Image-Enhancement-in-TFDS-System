Research on Image Enhancement of Railway Car Components in TFDS System
A TFDS image pre-processing method combining image edge enhancement and sparrow search algorithm is proposed to address the problems of underexposure, low contrast and blurred edge details of train images in the Trouble of moving Freight car Detection System(TFDS). The method first uses the Gauss-Laplace operator to detect and sharpen the edges of the image to enhance the sharpness of the edge details of train parts, and then uses the sparrow search algorithm to search for the optimal parameters of the non-complete Beta function to achieve adaptive enhancement of low-illumination images. The experimental results show that the method outperforms common TFDS image pre-processing algorithms in terms of information entropy, average gradient and contrast.
